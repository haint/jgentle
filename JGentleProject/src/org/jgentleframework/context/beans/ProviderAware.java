/**
 * Interface to be implemented by beans that wish to be aware of their owning
 * {@link Provider}. After bean instantiation, container will automate invoke
 * {@link #setProvider(Provider)} method and pass the current {@link Provider}
 * to the argument of method.
 * <p>
 * Generally, beans donâ€™t know (or even need to know) their names, how they are
 * instantiated or even that they are running within a JGentle container. This
 * is usually a good thing because if a bean is aware of the container, then it
 * becomes coupled with JGentle and may not be able to exist outside of the
 * container. But sometimes, beans need to know more. Sometimes they need to
 * know the truth who they are and where they are running.
 * <p>
 * For example, beans can look up collaborating beans, or definitions via the
 * {@link Provider} (Dependency Lookup). Note that most beans will choose to
 * receive references to collaborating beans via corresponding bean properties
 * or constructor arguments (Dependency Injection).
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * <p>
 * - The {@link #setProvider(Provider)} method will be invoked before the
 * {@link Initializing#activate()} method is invoked.
 * <p>
 * - For a list of all bean lifecycle methods, see the {@link Initializing} and
 * {@link Disposable}.
