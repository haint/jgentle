Welcome to The JGentle Framework
=============================

JGentle's features are referred to as Inversion of Control (IoC) Container or Lightweight Container. 
The adoption of JGentle in an application ensures the use of certain design principles which improve encapsulation, 
modularization, testability and reusability, offering configuration via Dependency Injection, Definition Management, 
Annotation Injection, and declarative services via AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming).
